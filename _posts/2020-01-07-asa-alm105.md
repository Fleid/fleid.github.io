# Unit-testing an Azure Stream Analytics job

This article is part of a series on enabling modern ALM practices for an Azure Stream Analytics project:

## Context

Now that we have a **continuous build pipeline** (see [103](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-103/)) and **automated deployments** (see [104](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-104/)), we should turn our attention towards **test automation**. These are the 3 practices that will allow us to enable proper CI/CD, a key aspect of DevOps.

To be honest **we should have started with test automation**, via unit testing, before doing anything else in Azure DevOps. In my opinion it is the most important practice of modern ALM. But it took me a [little bit of prep time](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-202002/) before being able to implement automated testing for ASA and write that article.

The main reason being that at the moment, **unit testing is not supported natively for ASA in either VSCode or Visual Studio**. This article will show us how to go around that, using a tool I built and made available on Github: [asa.unittest](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest).

It is to be noted that **asa.unittest** is still a [work in progress](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest/projects/1). In consequence I expect this article to be updated regularly in the near future.

## Introduction to asa.unittest

The [github repository](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest) of asa.unittest has a README that gives us some details on what the tool does and how it works.

The short version is that we'll need to prepare a fixture, a fancy terms for a folder structure and a couple of files, for it to run.

But let's not worry to much about how the tool work, and focus on getting it running in our project.

## Requirements and setup

The [requirements](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest#requirements) are fairly standards (PowerShell, Node/NPM, .NET Framework), but make it apparent that **the tool will only work on Windows**. This is due to the limited availability of the `sa.exe` command used under the cover to run the ASA engine programmatically.

Once the requirements are installed, we can download the tool in a zip file from [the repo](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest).

If it's not already the case, we will need to have a solution folder that will contain both our existing ASA project folder and the new unit test folder. Depending on how version-control was configured, and how the build and release pipelines are setup, this can actually break a lot of things.

Let's try to keep most of the wiring working by:

- Creating a new `ASATest1` folder in our existing `ASATest1` folder
- Moving the ASA content into it : folders (Functions, Inputs, LocalRunOutputs, Outputs) and files (asaproj.json, ASATest1.asaql, JobConfig.json) into it
- Leaving the other folders untouched (Deploy, Provision) and YAML config file
- Adding the `unittest` folder in the root folder

On a picture:

The zip file should contain a subfolder called `unittest`.


## Local unit-testing

## Testing in the build pipeline

## Success

We now have continuous builds and automated deployments, let's turn our attention to automated testing so we can finally enable proper CI/CD.
