What's next for **asa.unittest** now that **Azure Stream Analytics** comes with a unit testing tool.

<!--more-->

[Last month](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure/azure-stream-analytics-adds-support-for-unit-testing-in-a-ci-cd/ba-p/1690089) the ASA team updated **azure-streamanalytics-cicd**, their companion [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-streamanalytics-cicd). It now includes the `addtestcase` and `test` commands that add support for query unit testing. These commands are well [documented]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/cicd-tools?tabs=visual-studio-code#automated-test)) and quite easy to use.

I've just released [asa.unittest 1.1.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/asa.unittest/1.1.0) that now comes with helper tools to migrate tests built for **asa.unittest** to the new format expected by the CI/CD tool. I document the process below.

## Future of asa.unittest (or lack of)

To be honest I've not yet decided what to do with **asa.unittest** now that it's been made redundant. This module has been both a challenging project and a big accomplishment for me. I'm not sure there's a point in investing more time now that unit testing is supported by the product directly.

I'm pretty happy that building it provided coverage while the ASA team was working on enabling unit testing themselves. What is awesome is that I was also invited by them to review their design, and was able to contribute to it (to be noted, I'm a Microsoft employee at the time of writing).

Also I learned a ton about PowerShell, and releasing and maintaining an open source tool. That's been fantastic.

So 5 stars, I would do it again, but let's move on!

## Migrating from asa.unittest to azure-streamanalytics-cicd

It's actually pretty straightforward to move from one tool to the other. There are just 3 areas that need an intervention.

### 1 - Test files

In **asa.unittest**, the expected output files (`*~output~*~*.json`) should be [formatted](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest#configuring-a-test-case) as proper arrays of messages (`[{...},{...}]`).

In **azure-streamanalytics-cicd**, the test runner instead expects a line separated format (`{...}{...}`). It's actually not a bad idea since it's the format being outputted during local runs. It should make test generation easier.

I've added `Set-AutNewFormatOutputFiles` as a new command to **asa.unittest** to transform existing files easily. What it does is copy existing output files in an archive folder, and update the format of the files in the existing folder. It's meant to facilitate the conversion process, since **asa.unittest** now supports both formats.

To make things clear:

- Run `Set-AutNewFormatOutputFiles` to update the output files format in place. It can be run on files in the new format with no impact
- You can now run both **asa.unittest** and **azure-streamanalytics-cicd** on the newly formatted files
- New tests should be added with the new line separated format

The syntax :

```PowerShell

$solutionPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest"
$asaProjectName = "ASA.Application1"
$unittestFolder = "ASA.Application1.Tests"

#if missing, -archivePath will default to ..\1_arrange\archive_<timestamp>

Set-AutNewFormatOutputFiles `
    -solutionPath $solutionPath `
    -asaProjectName $asaProjectName `
    -unittestFolder $unittestFolder

```

If a file can't be archived, it won't be updated.
I tested it extensively, but please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest/issues) if you encounter any issue.

### 2 - Test manifest

In **asa.unittest**, the runner knows what test to run using a [naming convention](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest#configuring-a-test-case) on test files. It was easy for me to implement, but was not the best long term idea (if only for the test files potential duplications).

I was planning to switch to a manifest based test declaration, **azure-streamanalytics-cicd** does it for me.

For new tests, [there's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/cicd-tools?tabs=visual-studio-code#add-a-test-case) `azure-streamanalytics-cicd addtestcase`.

For existing tests, there's `New-AutManifestFromFiles`. It will read an existing `1_arrange` folder and generate a corresponding `testConfig.json` file:

```JSON
{
  "Script": "",
  "TestCases": [
    {
      "Name": "Case 1",
      "Inputs": [
        {
          "InputAlias": [Input alias string],
          "Type": "Data Stream",
          "Format": "JSON",
          "FilePath": [Required],
          "ScriptType": "InputMock"
        }
      ],
      "ExpectedOutputs": [
        {
          "OutputAlias": [Output alias string],
          "FilePath": "Required",
          "Required": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The syntax :

```PowerShell

$solutionPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest"
$asaProjectName = "ASA.Application1"
$unittestFolder = "ASA.Application1.Tests"

#if missing, -outputFilePath will default to ..\1_arrange\testConfig_<timestamp>.json

New-AutManifestFromFiles `
    -solutionPath $solutionPath `
    -asaProjectName $asaProjectName `
    -unittestFolder $unittestFolder
```

I also tested this one extensively. Again, please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest/issues) if you encounter any issue.

### 3 - Test calls

Now that output test files are converted to the new format, and we have a manifest, calling **azure-streamanalytics-cicd** will be easy:

```PowerShell

#The new command expects a path to either asaproj.json (VSCode) or <project>.asaproj (Visual Studio) in the projectFullPath

$projectFullPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest\ASATest1\asaproj.json"
$testFullPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest\ASATest1.Tests\testConfig.json"
$outputPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest\ASATest1.Tests\testRuns\" + (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss")

azure-streamanalytics-cicd test -project $projectFullPath -testConfigPath $testFullPath -outputPath $outputPath
```

Which previously was equivalent to:

```PowerShell
$asaProjectName = "ASA.Application1"
$solutionPath = "C:\users\fleide\Repos\ASATest\"
$unittestFolder = "ASA.Application1.Tests"
$asanugetversion = "3.0.0"
Start-AutRun `
    -asaProjectName $asaProjectName `
    -solutionPath $solutionPath `
    -unittestFolder $unittestFolder `
    -asanugetversion $asanugetversion `
    -verbose

```

Hope that helps! Any issues: please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fleid/asa.unittest/issues).
