# Basic ALM setup for Azure Stream Analytics,Part 2 - ASA-ALM-102

This is the **second article** of a series on enabling modern ALM practices for an Azure Stream Analytics project. Here's the [first one](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-101/).

## Context

We are [continuing the work](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-101/) of enabling modern ALM practices for our ASA project.

This time we will start with building a live streaming job, so we give ourselves the opportunity to feel the pain of deploying running jobs. Once this is done, we will set up a build pipeline (generate and validate ARM templates), followed by a release pipeline (execute ARM deployment).

The ASA job we will use is the one offered in the [quick-start tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-portal) of the official documentation. Events are generated in the [Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online simulator](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/) (it's a simulator, no need for a physical device), pushed to an IoT Hub, ingested by the ASA job and output to a blob store.

Let's get started!

## Live data source

The first part to build is the data source. We should not consider that data source as part of our project. It could be used by another ASA job, or any other consumer application. That's why we'll put it in a separate resource group: ```rg-shared```.

- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a new resource group to hold our shared assets: ```rg-shared```
- Let's create the IoT Hub following [that step](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-portal#prepare-the-input-data) (1 to 8) replacing the resource group attribute by ```rg-shared```
- Then let's start the IoT simulator by following [this step](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-portal#run-the-iot-simulator). The IoT hub will store these events for us while we setup our job.

Once this is done, we can start provisioning our project resources.

## Provisioning

We will not use the portal to provision our resource group, ASA job and storage account. Instead we will using both the **Azure CLI** and **PowerShell**.
Why two tools? We would use only the Az CLI if we could. In my opinion it's simpler and more practical. The thing is that at the time of writing it doesn't have an option to create ASA jobs. That's what we will use PowerShell for.

It is to be noted that it is usually a pain to get each of these tools happy, and in the right version.

- For the Azure CLI, the [install procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) should be straightforward, particularly on Windows where there's [an executable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest)
    - Once installed, do run the ```az login``` command in a terminal (cmd) to connect your environment to your Azure subscription
- For PowerShell, two steps:
    - While not mandatory it's better (the only option cross-platform though) to [install version 6 or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6), an awkward dance of going to its [release page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases), finding a version we like (latest neither preview or release candidate, [v6.2.3](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v6.2.3) at the time of writing), looking under assets and finding the right version (...-win-x64.msi for Windows folks)
    - Then we will need to install the **Azure PowerShell Az** module, which [should be easy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-3.2.0)... well, if you hadn't already installed the **Azure PowerShell AzureRM** module. In which case you will need version 6.x or above, since AzureRM can't live there, or [uninstall it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/uninstall-az-ps?view=azps-3.2.0#uninstall-the-azurerm-module) from your existing environment (but what about your existing scripts?). Let this be a good reminder that we will often find commands for **AzureRM** (older. so more docs and blog posts about it) that won't work as is in **Az**, usually an equivalent command exists, we just need to look them up [in the doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/?view=azps-3.2.0)

Hopefully this didn't take a complete afternoon, so let's start using these tools.
