# Build and Release pipelines for an Azure Stream Analytics job - ASA-ALM-103

This article is part of a series on enabling modern ALM practices for an Azure Stream Analytics project:

- Part 0 : [The story of 2 pipelines](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-100/)
- Part 1 : [Developer experience](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-101/)

- Part 3 : [Build and release pipelines](https://www.eiden.ca/asa-alm-103/)

## Context

Now that we have a job that can run live, with its data source and sink, we can start thinking [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD).

**CI for Continuous Integration**, which is the practice of building our application as often as possible, ideally every time there is a code change. The point, when working as a team on a single scope of work, is to be sure that our code base is always in a happy place as we work collaboratively on it. This will be done in [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops), in the **Build** section. Triggering our builds should be pushs to our central repository.

**CD for Continuous Deployment**, which is the practice of deploying our code to the next environment if its build succeeds (this is a bit more complicated than that, but let's go with that). This will again be done in **Azure Pipelines**, but this time in the **Release** section.

It is to be noted that I'm not an expert of Azure DevOps, so any [feedback](https://github.com/Fleid/fleid.github.io/tree/master/_posts) on how to do things in a more elegant way is appreciated.
